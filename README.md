# ðŸŽ£ Fishing Jigsaw
## About The Project
This project aims to create a software capable of compute a *promising* solution in an acceptable amount of time in order to maximize the rewards for a given state of the *Fishing Jigsaw* game.

## The Problem
Fishing Jigsaw is a non-deterministic problem which is *difficult* to compute its best solution since in order to find it, the software would have to compute all possible states of the current board *which is very expensive*.

### Game Rules
- The aim of the game is to fill all the spaces of the board.

- You will receive a reward depending on the numbers of attempts you make in order to fill the board, *the less amount of attempts you make the better reward you will get*.

- There are 6 types of figures you can get while playing the game, you will get one of them randomly each round.

- Every round you will be able to put the current figure in a valid position or skip it.

## Approach
The approach used to solve the the game tree is a breadth-first search (BFS)-like algorithm that exhaustively explores all possible board configurations and figure placements to compute the optimal actions for solving the puzzle.
